*Executive Summary*: Bill Mann and Andy Cross compete on the Market Cap Game Show for the world championship title.  Andy Cross wins with a score of 5.5 to Bill Mann's 5.0.


*Summary:*
This is the Market Cap Game Show World Championship, hosted by David Gardner.  Bill Mann and Andy Cross face off for the title. Players at home are invited to play along, and if their score is 18.5 or higher, they can consider themselves world champions. 

Bill and Andy guess the market caps of various companies.  If their guesses are both right, the tighter range wins; if both are wrong, whoever's range is closest to the actual market cap wins.  Bill Mann wins the first round, guessing the market cap of Union Pacific (UNP), and Andy Cross wins the second, guessing Walker & Dunlop (WD). 

In the second half, the score is tied 3-3 after six rounds, and Andy takes the lead 4-3 with a correct guess for Inari Medical (NARI). Bill ties it up 4-4 by correctly guessing Dexcom (DXCM).  

With the score tied 4-4, they move on to a tie-breaker round to determine the winner, with the stock Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). It appears Andy has won with a tighter range, but Rick Engdahl points out that because both contestants guessed a range that included the correct market cap, the tighter range wins according to the official rules.  The final score is Andy Cross: 5.5, Bill Mann: 5.0, and Andy Cross is declared the world champion.  Players at home are invited to celebrate if they also scored 18.5.
