*Executive Summary*: The title, "I Fought The Law (And The Law Won)", refers to the difference between laws and rules. Rules are made to be broken but laws are not. The host uses the song "I Fought the Law" as a metaphor to illustrate the consequences of breaking laws, which are often serious and unavoidable, unlike breaking rules. 


*Summary:*
This podcast is the second in an episodic series from host David Gardner exploring six different laws.  He discusses how rules are meant to be broken, while laws should be respected. Laws often have more serious consequences than rules if broken.  The six laws discussed include: Newton's First Law of Motion, Arthur C. Clarke's Second Law, Sutton's Law, Amara's Law, Cunningham's Law, and Hofstadter's Law. These laws are examined through the lens of investing, business, and life. He stresses the importance of taking risks, going where the money is, understanding hype cycles and recognizing that things may take longer to happen than anticipated.
