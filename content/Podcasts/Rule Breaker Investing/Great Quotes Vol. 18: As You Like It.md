*Executive Summary*: This episode explores five great quotes from Shakespeare's As You Like It, relating them to investing, business, and life.


*Summary:*
This week's Rule Breaker Investing podcast is about five great quotes from Shakespeare's comedy, As You Like It.   The play centers on themes of love, identity, transformation, and the transient nature of existence.  David Gardner shares five of his favorite quotes, highlighting how they relate to investing, business, and life.  \"All the world's a stage\" is discussed in relation to the roles companies play as either rule-makers or rule-breakers.  \"'Twas I, but 'tis not I\" explores how companies and individuals change over time, illustrated by examples like Amazon's transition from a bookseller to a tech giant and the shifting fortunes of Teledoc. \"Happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style\" emphasizes embracing the inherent uncertainties of investing. Gardner advocates for a buy-and-hold strategy, employing dollar-cost averaging for a \"quiet and sweet style.\" The humorous line \"Sell when you can; you are not for all markets\" sparks laughter while highlighting the importance of adaptability and recognizing when a company's time may have passed. Lastly, the quote \"A fool, a fool! I met a fool in the forest - a motley fool\" reveals the origin of the company's name and celebrates the unconventional wisdom that underpins the Rule Breaker philosophy.  Gardner concludes by encouraging listeners to embrace the unconventional, find joy in the journey, and celebrate the wisdom hidden within folly.  He emphasizes the power of thinking differently, acting unconventionally, and pursuing a more fulfilling life by aligning actions with personal convictions.
