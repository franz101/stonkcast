*Executive Summary*: Buy-now-pay-later financing is not regulated like credit cards and could become a problem for users who overextend themselves financially. There are concerns about high levels of consumer debt due to credit cards, buy now pay later, and other types of debt.


*Summary:*
The audio is a mailbag episode from the Rule Breaker Investing podcast hosted by David Gardner, co-founder of the Motley Fool.  David opens the episode with a recap of previous April episodes. He then dives into listener mailbag questions with help from Motley Fool staff including Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross and long-time Fool Robert Brokamp. Mailbag questions covered include whether gold has a role in an investment portfolio, how equally weighted ETFs work and potential pitfalls to consider, and the growth of buy-now-pay-later financing and whether it could lead to a financial crisis. Lastly, David provides updates and performance reviews on two five-stock samplers.  David closes the episode by reflecting on the impact of Rick Engdahl, producer of the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, who is about to begin a sabbatical.
