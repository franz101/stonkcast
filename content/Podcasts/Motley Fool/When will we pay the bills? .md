*Executive Summary*: The podcast does not address bill payments.


*Summary:*
This is a Motley Fool Money podcast episode. The hosts Scott and Andrew Page talked about their live event last week, and how they ordered pizza afterwards. They transitioned to discussing the unusual macro trend of gold prices nearing an all-time record while stock markets in the US and Australia are also at or near all-time highs. They debated the possible reasons, with Andrew suggesting it could be due to skepticism about the US dollar given the country's growing debt and China and Russia shifting their central bank reserves away from US treasuries. Scott posited that there's simply a lot of money chasing assets, leading to price growth across various asset classes, including gold and stocks. They also discussed the impact of government spending on inflation and job creation, using the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) as an example. They critiqued the NDIS structure, arguing that it's been poorly designed and has perverse consequences. Andrew argued that governments are exploiting the ability to create new money to fund spending without consequences, leading to market distortions. They concluded by lamenting the lack of intelligent public discourse on these issues and the erosion of quality journalism, which they believe is crucial for holding politicians accountable and fostering informed debate.
