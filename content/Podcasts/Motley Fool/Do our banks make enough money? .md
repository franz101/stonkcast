*Executive Summary*: The profitability of banks is a complex issue. While Australian banks have been historically profitable, there are concerns about their reliance on low interest rates for depositors and the potential risks associated with government intervention in the market. 


*Summary:*
The US inflation rate increased to 3.5% from 3.2% due to rising housing and fuel prices, raising concerns about its impact on Australia's economy. The RBA initially believed that Australia would not be affected by the US inflation, but it now appears unlikely that Australia can avoid similar price increases. The bond market reflects the consensus sentiment that the future economic outlook is not positive, as indicated by the inverted yield curve where long-term bond yields are lower than short-term bond yields. This inversion is often seen before recessions. The podcast hosts discuss the potential impact of rising interest rates on mortgage rates, arguing that banks need to offer higher interest rates to attract deposits in a competitive global market. Macquarie data reveals that Commonwealth Bank earns $1.7 billion annually by offering lower interest rates to depositors compared to market rates. They also highlight the potential risks of government intervention in the market, using the example of Australia's automotive industry, which was propped up for years with subsidies and tariffs but never became self-sustaining. The conversation then shifts to the merits of comparative advantage and specialization in a global economy, arguing that countries should focus on producing goods and services where they have a natural advantage, such as Australia's natural resources, tourism, and education system. The podcast concludes with a discussion of the importance of a robust and free market where businesses can innovate and thrive without excessive government intervention.
