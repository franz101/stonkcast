*Executive Summary*: The four rules for using AI discussed in this audio are: (1) Invite AI into everything you do to discover its applications; (2) Learn to be the human in the loop, understanding what you are uniquely good at and delegating other tasks to AI; (3) Treat the AI like a person, as it is trained on human language and interactions; and (4) Remember that this is the worst AI you'll ever use, as the technology is rapidly evolving. 


*Summary:*
The Disney board won approval over activist investor Nelson Peltz, who, along with his firm Trian Partners, had been pushing for changes at the company. Despite this defeat, Peltz and his firm made a significant profit on their investment in Disney. The company now needs to focus on fixing its movie studio, streaming offering, and creating a succession plan for CEO Bob Iger. A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan, causing over a thousand injuries and several deaths. The tremor also briefly disrupted chip production for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), highlighting the global dependence on Taiwan for sophisticated chip manufacturing. Intel reported operating losses of $7 billion for 2023 from its chip manufacturing business, signaling the expensive and long-term nature of its bet on becoming a major chip manufacturer. Google parent Alphabet is rumored to be interested in acquiring the digital marketing business HubSpot, in a move that is likely defensive as Google faces antitrust lawsuits and competition from AI in its core markets. Spotify is raising prices again for subscribers in the United States and other markets, its second price hike in recent history, to cover the costs of its audiobook program. Levi Strauss & Co. (Levi's) reported strong earnings, with their direct-to-consumer model driving growth and share prices to 12-month highs. Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) closed its acquisition of Trump Media & Technology Group, bringing former President Trump's Truth Social public at a $9 billion valuation despite the business having only $4 million in revenue and significant losses in 2023.
