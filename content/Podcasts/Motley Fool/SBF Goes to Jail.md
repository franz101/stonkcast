*Executive Summary*: Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for securities fraud related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX.


*Summary:*
This audio is an interview with Zeke Faux, author of the book "Number Go Up", about Sam Bankman-Fried's trial and sentencing. Faux summarizes the events leading up to Bankman-Fried's arrest, including his use of customer funds to cover trading losses, his attempts to unfreeze funds in a Chinese exchange through bribes and elaborate schemes, and his ultimately unsuccessful defense strategy of maintaining innocence. The interview also touches upon the philosophical inconsistencies surrounding Bitcoin, its recent resurgence, and the rise of meme coins like Dogecoin and Dog With a Hat. Faux expresses concern about the lack of intrinsic value in these cryptocurrencies and the potential for significant financial losses, drawing parallels to the GameStop and AMC excitement. He highlights the story of a Russian smuggler using Tether to procure electronics for the war in Ukraine, illustrating the cryptocurrency's unintended consequences. The conversation concludes with a discussion about Axie Infinity and its currency, Smooth Love Potion, emphasizing the need for greater accountability in the crypto world.
