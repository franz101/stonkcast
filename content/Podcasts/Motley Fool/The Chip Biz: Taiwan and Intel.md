*Executive Summary*: Taiwan's largest earthquake in 25 years poses risks to chip manufacturing due to the island's central role in the global chip supply chain. TSMC, a major chip producer, is experiencing disruptions but is well-prepared. Meanwhile, Intel is pushing into the chip manufacturing business despite current losses.


*Summary:*
This audio segment discusses the impact of a recent earthquake in Taiwan on the global chip supply chain, particularly on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The hosts highlight the company's preparedness for such events and the global reliance on a small region for advanced chip production. They also discuss Intel's ambitions in the foundry business, despite current losses, and the potential for diversification outside of Taiwan with initiatives like the CHIPS Act. The conversation then shifts to Disney's successful defense against activist investors and the company's path towards recovery under CEO Bob Iger. The final part of the audio features an interview with Spire Global CEO Peter Platzer, who advocates for every company to have a 'space strategy' leveraging data from satellites. He emphasizes Spire's focus on weather forecasting and their partnership with NVIDIA to enhance weather prediction accuracy using AI and machine learning. Platzer envisions a future where Spire's data and technology contribute to tackling climate change, improving global security, and achieving more precise weather predictions.
