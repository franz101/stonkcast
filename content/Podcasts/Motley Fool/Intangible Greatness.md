*Executive Summary*: The title "Intangible Greatness" refers to the value of relationships and community, which traditional accounting practices often overlook. James Rhee, former CEO of Ashley Stewart, recognized the "intangible greatness" within the company's customer base and used it as a foundation for the business's successful reinvention.


*Summary:*
James Rhee, a Korean-American professor and former CEO of Ashley Stewart, discusses his new book, "Red Helicopter." The book, part business story, part memoir, and part manifesto, recounts Rhee's experience revitalizing Ashley Stewart, a clothing retailer catering to plus-size, moderate-income Black women. Rhee initially became involved as an activist investor but stepped in as CEO to save the company from a second bankruptcy. His approach emphasized kindness, mathematical honesty, and employee agency. He restructured operations, challenged conventional accounting principles, and empowered employees by fostering trust and transparency.
