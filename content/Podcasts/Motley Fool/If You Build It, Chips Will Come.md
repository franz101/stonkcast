*Executive Summary*: The title refers to the CHIPS Act and its intended effect of boosting domestic semiconductor production.  The influx of chip manufacturers like TSMC to the US, particularly Arizona, is expected to drive economic growth and create jobs, hence the phrase 'chips will come'.


*Summary:*
The podcast discusses the impact of the CHIPS Act on semiconductor growth in the US, focusing on TSMC's investment in a third chip factory in Phoenix, Arizona.  It explores the challenges associated with this endeavor, such as the high costs and potential setbacks in building fabs, as well as the strain on infrastructure, particularly housing and water resources, in Phoenix due to a booming population and limited resources. The conversation then shifts to Jamie Dimon's annual letter, highlighting his views on the economy and his potential role as a successor to Warren Buffet in terms of influence. Dimon's concerns about a treacherous geopolitical era, inflationary pressures, and the shrinking of public markets are discussed. The discussion concludes with an overview of activist investors, differentiating them from short sellers and exploring their strategies, motivations, and impact on companies. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the activist's track record, platform, and the potential implications for investors.
