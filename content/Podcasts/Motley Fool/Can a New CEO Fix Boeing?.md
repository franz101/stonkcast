*Executive Summary*: A new CEO could potentially help fix Boeing but it will be a long and challenging process requiring a cultural shift, an emphasis on quality and control, and strong leadership.


*Summary:*
Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun is stepping down at the end of the year following issues with the 737 Max line. Emily Flippen and Jason Moser discuss the importance of finding an external replacement for Calhoun who has experience in turning around struggling companies. They compare Boeing's situation to Wells Fargo's recent scandal, highlighting the need for a cultural shift and an emphasis on quality and control. They also talk about two big deals in the works: Johnson & Johnson's potential acquisition of medical device maker Shockwave Medical and Home Depot's purchase of professional supply company SRS Distribution. Emily and Jason discuss the strategic implications of these acquisitions, noting Johnson & Johnson's focus on medical devices and Home Depot's increasing focus on the professional market. They also talk about the potential regulatory challenges facing Home Depot's acquisition. Later in the show, Emily and Jason discuss Amazon's increased investment in Anthropic, a generative AI startup and competitor to OpenAI. They talk about the potential of AI and the significance of Amazon's investment. They also discuss McCormick's recent earnings report, which showed better-than-expected results despite macroeconomic pressures. Finally, Dylan Lewis speaks with Tarang Amin, CEO of e.l.f. Beauty, about the company's successful social strategy on platforms like TikTok and Roblox. They discuss e.l.f.'s unconventional approach to marketing, its focus on Gen Z consumers, and its ability to capture market share from older competitors. Amin highlights the importance of innovation and value proposition in building customer loyalty in the beauty industry. He explains e.l.f.'s Holy Grail innovation approach, which involves taking inspiration from its community and prestige products and introducing them at a much better value. He also emphasizes the company's focus on building franchises rather than relying on one-and-done product launches. The episode concludes with Jason and Emily discussing stocks on their radar: Masimo and Mastercard, respectively.
