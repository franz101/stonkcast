*Executive Summary*: Braze, a customer engagement platform, is doing well. With recent growth and revenue increases, the company is set to continue this pattern.


*Summary:*
Braze is a customer engagement platform that helps businesses connect with their customers. The company's CEO, Bill Magnuson, believes that Braze is solving a fundamental problem in capitalism by helping businesses build stronger relationships with their customers. Braze does this by providing businesses with the tools they need to understand their customers and engage with them in a relevant way. Braze's approach to customer engagement is based on the idea that businesses should focus on building relationships with people, rather than channels. The company's platform is designed to help businesses engage with customers across all channels, including mobile, email, web, and more. Braze's platform is built on top of an event-driven stream processor, which allows it to process data in real-time and take action on it immediately. This real-time capability is essential for businesses that want to be able to engage with their customers in a personalized and relevant way. Braze has a diverse customer base, with customers ranging from small startups to large global multinationals. The company is also well-diversified across verticals, with no meaningful concentration in any given vertical. Braze is continuing to expand its product surface area over time, with new channels and features being added regularly. The company is also expanding its global footprint, with new offices being opened in key markets around the world. Braze's growth potential is significant, given the large market opportunity that it is addressing. The company is well-positioned to continue to grow in the years to come, as businesses increasingly look to mobile to engage with their customers. Braze is a publicly traded company and is considered a growth stock by investors.
