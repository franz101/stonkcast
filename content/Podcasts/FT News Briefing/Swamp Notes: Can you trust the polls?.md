*Executive Summary*: The accuracy of political polls has been a subject of debate, particularly since the 2016 US election. This podcast episode delves into the reliability of polls in the current political climate, considering factors like voter sentiment, candidate visibility, and methodological challenges.


*Summary:*
This podcast episode from the FT News Briefing, "Swamp Notes," discusses the relevance and accuracy of political polls in the context of the 2024 US election. Host Mark Filipino, along with guests Lauren Fedor (FT's deputy Washington bureau chief) and John McHenry (vice president of North Star Opinion Research), dissect recent FT poll findings. Key takeaways include Biden's declining approval ratings, primarily attributed to economic concerns such as inflation and housing costs. While voters perceive Trump as better equipped to handle the economy, his limited public appearances since leaving office have potentially benefited him by reducing his visibility.  The discussion highlights the challenges of conducting reliable polls in the Trump era, citing voter skepticism towards institutions and the underrepresentation of certain demographics. The episode concludes with a lighthearted analysis of a failed attempt in Kyle, Texas, to break the world record for the largest gathering of people with the same name.
