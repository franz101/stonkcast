*Executive Summary*: The title refers to the impact of a strong US dollar on the global financial system, particularly the pressure it puts on foreign currencies due to high US interest rates.


*Summary:*
The US Supreme Court has ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding model is constitutional, a relief to federal agencies. The strong US dollar, linked to high interest rates, is causing stress globally, particularly impacting currencies like the Japanese Yen.  China and Russia are strengthening military ties in response to what they call "destructive and hostile US pressure." US property funds, including a $10 billion fund managed by Starwood, are facing challenges as investors demand their money back amid high interest rates and a struggling property market.
