*Executive Summary*: The International Criminal Court is considering opening an investigation into potential war crimes committed during the ongoing conflict in Gaza.


*Summary:*
The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and senior Hamas leaders, alleging war crimes. This legal escalation comes amid mounting international criticism of Israel's Gaza offensive. The move is largely symbolic, as it's unlikely Netanyahu or the other leaders would be arrested if they traveled to other countries, but it has sparked outrage in Israel and raised questions about the practicality of such warrants. Meanwhile, consumer confidence in most wealthy economies hasn't rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, according to the OECD, highlighting the lingering impact of the cost of living crisis.  Iran is gearing up for an emergency election following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash. Raisi was widely viewed as a potential successor to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his death has created uncertainty about the country's future. The election, expected within 50 days, is likely to see the hardline factions consolidate their grip on power, potentially impacting Iran's domestic and foreign policy. In the US, the head of the banking regulator, FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, is stepping down following an investigation that revealed a misogynistic workplace culture and raised concerns about his leadership.
