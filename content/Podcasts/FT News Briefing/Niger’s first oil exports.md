*Executive Summary*: Niger, with its new pipeline, is on the verge of becoming a major oil exporter, but a border dispute with Benin is currently hindering oil flow.


*Summary:*
Niger is poised to become a significant oil exporter thanks to a new 2,000-kilometer pipeline connecting its oil fields to ports in Benin.  This pipeline is expected to boost Niger's oil production from 20,000 to 110,000 barrels daily and could potentially lead to an 11% growth in its economy.  However, a border dispute between Niger and Benin, stemming from a military coup in Niger in July 2023, has halted the flow of oil.  ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Niger after the coup, leading to border closures and slowing down the pipeline's construction. Despite sanctions being lifted and relations resuming between Niger and other ECOWAS member states, Niger refuses to open its border with Benin, citing security concerns.  This situation presents a challenge to Niger's economic prospects and hinders West African integration efforts.  Meanwhile, Russia has dissolved a UN panel responsible for overseeing sanctions on North Korea. This move is seen as a way for Russia to protect its military ally, which has been supplying arms for its war in Ukraine. This development raises concerns about the future of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and highlights the increasing difficulty in achieving international cooperation on critical security issues.
