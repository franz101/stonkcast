*Executive Summary*: The Biden administration has increased tariffs on Chinese clean energy imports, including electric vehicles, in a move framed as protecting American jobs and industry. This action has sparked debate about potential impacts on consumers and the green transition.


*Summary:*
President Biden has enacted substantial tariff hikes on a range of clean energy imports from China. These tariffs, impacting goods such as electric vehicles, chips, steel, and aluminum, signify an escalation of the trade war initiated during the Trump administration. Biden's rationale for these tariffs is rooted in the protection of American jobs and the fostering of a domestic EV industry.  Opponents argue that these tariffs will likely lead to increased costs for consumers, potentially hindering the adoption of electric vehicles and slowing the decarbonization of the US economy.  However, the Biden administration's move might resonate with certain segments of the population, especially those concerned about American job security and competition from China.
