*Executive Summary*: The European Central Bank is preparing to cut interest rates, potentially as soon as next week.


*Summary:*
The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to cut interest rates as early as next week in an effort to combat wage growth and pressure on service prices. Chevron is facing a challenge in its bid to takeover Hess, as Exxon claims right of first refusal over Hess's stake in a massive oil field off the coast of Guyana. Thames Water is under fire for pumping billions of liters of sewage into the River Thames, becoming a political issue ahead of the general election. The nuclear power industry is struggling to rebuild its workforce due to a lack of hiring over the past few decades, despite a resurgence in the industry driven by climate change and energy security concerns. Companies are trying to attract younger workers by emphasizing the industry's role in addressing climate change, while also bringing back retired workers to fill the immediate skills gap.
