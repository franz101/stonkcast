*Executive Summary*: The audio does not refer to a hall of fame bull market, but rather, discusses a potential 25-year secular bull market, emphasizing that this prediction is subject to future market conditions.  


*Summary:*
The speaker discusses various stock market topics with Brian Belski, Chief Investment Strategist at BMO. They discuss the market's performance, the possibility of a recession, the impact of interest rates, and the potential of AI in stock picking. Belski believes we are in a 25-year secular bull market but cautions that a pullback of more than 5% is needed in the second year. He also highlights the monumental shift towards AI and productivity, suggesting that stock picking is entering a golden age.  They analyze various companies, including Netflix, JP Morgan, Meta, Uber, Target, Walmart, Costco, Ford, GM, Google, Facebook, Simon Property Group, Starbucks, Robinhood, and Disney.  Belski believes in the long-term potential of the market, driven by factors like strong earnings growth and the return of equity investing's believability. He also suggests that the inverted yield curve is not a reliable indicator of a recession and that loan growth is now positive. He expresses concerns about the overvaluation of utilities due to the AI theme and suggests that financials are still underowned and have potential.  The conversation also touches upon private real estate investments like Blackstone's BREIT, questioning their structure and valuation practices. Belski acknowledges the risks associated with such investments and suggests that public REITs might be a more suitable option for most investors. The speaker and Belski share their personal experiences and investment strategies, including their views on catching falling knives and the importance of having a contrarian sleeve. They conclude by discussing the NBA playoffs and their excitement for the Knicks series.
