*Executive Summary*: Netflix does not own Marvel Studios. Disney owns Marvel Studios and licenses that content to various providers. However, the question posed is whether Netflix can develop a franchise similar to Marvel Studios that can generate globally adored IP.


*Summary:*
This podcast episode covers the share by service as a percentage of overall TV viewed in the United States. One point that is highlighted is that YouTube has a real big dominance at 9.7%. Netflix is the closest second with a 7.3% but that does not include YouTube TV. One reason for YouTube's success is the low cost associated with it's content and the use of generative AI. The stock market doesn't take into account YouTube as a competitor to Netflix, but with a limited number of hours a day people can watch content, they are definitely competing for audience attention. Netflix had an earnings call on April 18th in which the company beat on the top line and bottom line, including margin. The stock, however, was hammered and was down 10% the next day. This was in part due to their announcement of no longer reporting its user count and concerns with their content strategy. While Netflix has high convenience and creates shows that reach large audience clusters, the longevity of those titles is in question. Viewership drops significantly after 4 weeks. Additionally, they have few titles that see a strong ROI. On May 10th, Warner Bros Discovery, whose stock has been a disaster, had an earnings report that was less than ideal with misses across the board. CEO, David Zaslav, has been under the microscope for his decisions. There's a concern that while he's been good at cutting debt, it's unclear if he has the capability of building the company into a successful streaming business. One bright spot for the company is the potential for growth in their IP including Batman, Superman, and Harry Potter. Disney reported their earnings call on May 7th and beat on the top and bottom line. Their stock is on a good run and the company is excited about the future of streaming.  Parks and Experiences continue to be a big winner for Disney with huge growth, and Hulu is paramount to the Disney business. The biggest question surrounding Disney is whether the company can develop a hit like Frozen which came out 11 years ago.
