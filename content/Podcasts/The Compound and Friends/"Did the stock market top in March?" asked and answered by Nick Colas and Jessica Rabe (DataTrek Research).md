*Executive Summary*: It's statistically unlikely that the stock market topped in March. Historical data shows that the market usually peaks in Q4 during positive years and January during negative years.


*Summary:*
This podcast discusses whether the stock market topped in March. They talk about energy stocks as a hedge against oil price spikes and gold as a potential hedge against inflation. They also cover the likelihood of the S&P 500 having topped for the year, given historical data and recent market events. It is stated that the stock market typically peaks in Q4 during positive years and January during bad years. Historically, it is rare for the S&P 500 to peak between February and September, and when it does, it usually indicates a significant negative event such as geopolitical tension or Fed policy mistakes.  The podcast guests also discuss the recent rally in gold.  The podcast guests agree that the rally is primarily due to the Russia-Ukraine war and the subsequent weaponization of the US dollar. Central banks, particularly China, have increased their gold reserves significantly since 2020, seeking a safe and liquid asset that is not susceptible to US sanctions. The podcast hosts also examine the correlation between CPI and gasoline prices, noting that despite gasoline being a relatively small component of the CPI, it heavily influences inflation expectations and, consequently, actual inflation.  The hosts wrap up the podcast by discussing the impact of recessions on younger generations like Millennials and Gen Z. While a recession caused by an oil price shock could lead to job losses and financial hardship, it also presents opportunities for investment and career changes. They emphasize the importance for younger people to maintain an emergency fund of 3-6 months of living expenses and to be mentally prepared for economic downturns. They also highlight the historical resilience of the stock market and the potential for long-term growth.
