*Executive Summary*: The audio discusses the reasons and implications of the weak Japanese Yen, China's surprisingly strong export data, and how they relate to global economies.


*Summary:*
The episode discusses the recent weakness of the Japanese yen, China's export boom, and the implications for the global economy. Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, explains that the yen's weakness is due to low interest rates in Japan relative to the US and Europe. He argues that this weakness is a concern because it is pushing up the price of imports and reducing real wages in Japan. Setser also notes that China's export boom is tied to the auto sector, particularly electric vehicles, and that China has enormous capacity to produce solar panels and batteries, making it difficult for other countries to build up their own industries in these areas. He concludes that China's export boom is a "shock" to the global system and that there is concern that yen weakness is not actually helping to reflate Japan's economy.
