*Executive Summary*: Jeff Currie, Chief Strategy Officer of Energy Pathways at the Carlyle Group, believes that copper is his highest-conviction trade ever due to the anticipation of increasing demand and constraints on supply, despite the market's initial underperformance.


*Summary:*
The demand for copper is projected to be extremely high due to green technology advancements, AI development, and military demand, all while supply growth remains weak. This creates a "highest-conviction trade" scenario for investors, despite the market not performing as initially expected. The main reasons for the initial slowdown were a dip in the Chinese property market and a rise in disinflationary pressures due to regulatory easing in various sectors. However, with copper prices steadily increasing and the demand outlook remaining strong, the trend is expected to continue.  Despite this, major mining companies are still opting for mergers and acquisitions to increase supply instead of initiating new mining projects due to higher costs and longer lead times associated with the latter. This, along with the shift from dollar recycling to gold recycling, will likely drive copper prices higher. The guest, Jeff Currie, predicts a copper price target of around $15,000 per ton within a 2-3 year timeframe, driven by unprecedented demand and supply constraints. He argues that the lack of "sticks" or policies that disincentivize oil demand, despite the availability of such tools, is hindering the transition to green energy and limiting the decrease in oil demand. He expects a continuation of the trend of dollar diversification, with countries increasingly choosing to trade in their own currencies and potentially using commodities like copper as a strategic reserve.
