*Executive Summary*: The title is a bit misleading. While Google's AI advancements are significant, OpenAI is also making strides in the field. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of AI, and it's not accurate to say one is dictating the other's actions.


*Summary:*
The April inflation report showed prices cooling down, with core CPI rising 3.6% year-over-year, the lowest reading since April 2021. However, shelter inflation remains stubbornly high, increasing 0.4% this month and up 5.5% over the last 12 months. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs, but big tech companies are starting to lag. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index is catching up, indicating broader market participation. Google's AI updates focus on enhancing search with AI overviews and planning mechanisms. These changes could negatively impact traditional publishers who rely on advertising revenue. Google's Project Astra, an AI assistant that can run as a smartphone app or smart glasses, is seen as a small game changer for the company. OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT 4.0, an app-based version with enhanced conversational abilities. Compared to Google's Project Astra, ChatGPT 4.0 focuses on conversational AI, while Astra is more image and video-oriented. Boston Omaha, a holding company, lost one of its co-CEOs, Alex Rozek. The company's performance has been underwhelming, and the market is questioning its business model and goodwill value. The departure of Rozek, who focused on acquisitions, and the remaining CEO's focus on organic growth mark a shift in the investment thesis. Investors are waiting to see how the new strategy plays out.
