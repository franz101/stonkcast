*Executive Summary*: Hims & Hers, an online pharmacy and healthcare company, has entered the weight-loss market by offering compounded GLP-1 injections at a lower price point than branded options like Wegovy.


*Summary:*
The weight-loss market is seeing new competitors as demand for GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy continues to grow. Hims & Hers saw its stock rise over 30% after announcing plans to offer a compounded GLP-1 weight-loss injection. This move follows their existing comprehensive weight-loss program, which seeks to treat weight loss in a holistic way, similar to approaches taken by Weight Watchers. The FDA has allowed certain companies to provide generic or compounded versions of these drugs to address high demand. Hims & Hers has partnered with a generic wholesaler and will produce their offering in-house, allowing them to offer the treatment at a lower cost compared to brand-name drugs. While this expansion is promising for Hims & Hers, potential risks include the company's dual role as prescriber and provider of medication and the possibility of becoming overly reliant on prescriptions for growth. The discussion also touched upon the overall weight-loss market, noting that Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have seen significant gains due to the popularity of GLP-1 drugs. Meanwhile, Wix, a website builder, has seen its stock rise 25% after earnings. The company's success is attributed to its disciplined approach to cash flow and its embrace of AI in developing website building tools. Notably, Wix has introduced a conversational AI builder that can instantly develop websites based on user input. This feature has resonated with customers and partners, leading to faster growth and an optimistic outlook for the company.
