*Executive Summary*: Netflix will be the exclusive home for streaming NFL Christmas Day games for the next three years.


*Summary:*
The NFL has struck a deal with Netflix to exclusively stream Christmas Day games, with two games this year and at least one game for the next two years. This is a significant boost for Netflix's live events portfolio, providing access to the highly popular NFL and valuable advertising inventory. The NFL benefits from global audience expansion through Netflix's reach. While this deal marks a shift for Netflix, which previously avoided expensive sports rights, it signals the company's evolving strategy driven by the growth of its advertising tier and the potential for high viewership exceeding their original movie investments. The deal also highlights a broader trend of media companies bundling their streaming services (like Disney with Hulu and HBO Max, and Comcast with Netflix, Apple TV+, and Peacock) to compete for market share, signifying a return to cable-like packages. Meanwhile, Walmart reported strong earnings with increased revenue and high-income shoppers, benefiting from people cutting back on dining out due to inflation. Despite the travel industry experiencing a slight cooling down from its post-pandemic boom, it remains strong with airlines like Delta and American reporting record revenues and focusing on premium travelers. However, ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier face challenges due to competition and changing consumer preferences. Airbnb sees similar trends with continued but moderated growth in leisure travel, focusing on international expansion and experiences as key avenues for future growth.
