*Executive Summary*: Venture capitalists seek companies with an "A-level team" to increase the odds of getting an investment return of 100x or more.  Finding those companies requires investors to get outside of their comfort zone and be willing to meet with founders in unconventional settings.


*Summary:*
Venture capitalists are looking for home run investments that generate 100 times their original investment. They focus on A-level teams, even if they are pursuing a B-level idea, because a great team can pivot and execute even when faced with challenges. They look for founders with charisma, passion, and resilience who can build strong teams, adapt to changing circumstances, and overcome obstacles. They believe that team is the most important factor in a startup's success, more so than the product or market size.  They use a different approach to valuation, focusing on the amount of money needed to reach certain milestones.  They pay attention to the incentive structure of the company, looking for companies that are structured to encourage innovation and risk-taking at all levels. They are excited about the current crop of startups that are tackling big problems in areas like AI, space tech, robotics, CRISPR, biotech, defense, education, the future of work, and mental health.  They believe that we will see more disruption in traditional industries in the next 10 years than ever before, and this is a wake-up call for stock investors.
