*Executive Summary*: While the increasing market value of Bitcoin could theoretically impact currency exchange rates, the hosts argue that Bitcoin is effectively priced in US dollars and its Australian dollar value is primarily determined by the Bitcoin price in USD times the exchange rate, limiting arbitrage opportunities.


*Summary:*
This week's mailbag edition of Motley Fool Money features hosts Scott Phillips and Andrew Page discussing listener questions on a variety of investment topics. One listener asks about the relationship between risk and return, questioning whether risk is measured by volatility or permanent loss of capital. Andrew argues that while risk, defined either way, doesn't guarantee a better return, you can't achieve higher returns without taking on more risk. They also discuss whether to invest in AI chipmakers like Nvidia or the companies utilizing AI, like Google and Facebook, considering potential growth and valuation. Another listener grapples with investing paralysis due to identifying risks in all their holdings. Andrew advises recognizing that risks are inevitable and focusing on portfolio management, learning to cut losses and ride winners.  Brent asks about balancing dollar-cost averaging with waiting for market dips, especially when considering index investing. Andrew suggests consistent, automated investing for passive index approaches, while allowing for more discretion when stock picking. Lastly, Tim questions Bitcoin's independence from central currencies, given its rising value and arbitrage opportunities. Andrew emphasizes that value is always relative, and while Bitcoin can be arbitraged like any other currency, its primary value lies in its potential for long-term purchasing power, not short-term trading profits. He compares Bitcoin to gold as a store of value and encourages a long-term perspective rather than short-term speculation. Michael asks about Kogan's share buyback program, questioning the decision to repurchase shares at double the original price. Scott clarifies that the decision should be based on the company's current valuation, not anchored to past prices. He argues that if Kogan believes its shares are undervalued, they should continue buybacks, but stop if the price exceeds their intrinsic value assessment.  Overall, the hosts emphasize the importance of independent valuation, recognizing risks, and making informed decisions based on a long-term perspective, rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations.
