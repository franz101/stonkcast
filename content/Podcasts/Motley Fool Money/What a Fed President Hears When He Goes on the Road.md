*Executive Summary*: A Fed president on a listening tour hears about the challenges businesses are facing, including inflation, the labor market, consumer demand, and the general economic outlook. 


*Summary:*
Tom Barkin, president and CEO of the Richmond Fed, travels around his district to learn about the businesses in his area and what they are seeing when it comes to inflation, labor market, consumer demand and the general economic outlook. He travels to small towns like Mount Airy, North Carolina, the inspiration for Mayberry, and Yadkinville, North Carolina, where he meets with business owners in manufacturing, textiles, and other industries.  While these businesses have had to adjust to some post-pandemic pressures, they still face restraining factors, such as inflation, labor costs, and access to capital. Barkin uses the anecdotal information he gathers from these meetings to supplement the official data the Fed collects, giving him a real-time sense of what's happening in the economy.  These meetings are also an opportunity for local business leaders to learn about the Fed, what it does and how it works.
