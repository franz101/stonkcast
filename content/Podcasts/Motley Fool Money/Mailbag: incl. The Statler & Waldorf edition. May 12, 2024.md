*Executive Summary*: This podcast episode is a listener mailbag episode featuring Andrew Page, the founder of Strawman.com, a website focused on investment ideas and discussion. The hosts discuss topics ranging from the impact of AI on centrally planned economies to managing portfolios with losing stocks and the complexities of real estate investment in Australia.


*Summary:*
The hosts discuss listener feedback, including an AI face swap that depicts them as Statler and Waldorf from The Muppet Show. The first question explores the potential of AI to enable centrally planned economies, with the hosts acknowledging AI's transformative capabilities while expressing skepticism about its ability to overcome the inherent flaws of central planning. The second question delves into managing a portfolio with losing stocks. The hosts recommend selling stocks in which conviction has been lost, emphasizing the importance of learning from mistakes and making investment decisions based on a sound process rather than hope. They also delve into the complexities of real estate as an investment, particularly in Australia, where housing affordability is a significant concern. They critique government policies that artificially inflate property prices, arguing that these policies primarily serve to protect incumbent politicians and distort free markets. The final question involves a young investor seeking advice on liquidating assets to purchase a property. The hosts advise prioritizing long-term financial goals while acknowledging the emotional and lifestyle benefits of homeownership. They emphasize the importance of considering individual circumstances and risk tolerance when making investment decisions and recommend a diversified portfolio approach.
