*Executive Summary*: The audio discusses the recent resurgence of activity around meme stocks like GameStop, but it emphasizes that this is a much smaller and more cynical episode compared to the frenzy of 2021.


*Summary:*
This podcast discusses the recent resurgence of meme stock mania, focusing on GameStop (GME). Hosts Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal interview Luke Kawa, a markets editor at Robinhood's Sherwood Media and former Bloomberg colleague. They discuss the surprising return of meme stock volatility, the role of options trading, and the differences between this episode and the 2021 frenzy. Key points include the market's failure to price in the possibility of roaring kitty's return, the cynical nature of this round of meme stock activity, the impact of coordinated buying power on even large companies like Microsoft, and the legal liability concerns that may be driving WallStreetBets moderators to distance themselves from certain topics.
