*Executive Summary*: The world could experience a cocoa shortage due to a combination of factors such as weather, climate change, disease, and reduced fertilizer usage. This shortage, coupled with the inelastic demand for cocoa, could lead to a depletion of cocoa bean inventories. 


*Summary:*
Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management, discusses the cocoa market. He believes there is a massive supply shortage this year, with production down 17% from last year. He attributes the decline to factors such as weather, climate change, diseases, and decreased fertilizer usage. Andurand suggests that demand for cocoa is inelastic because it constitutes a small portion of consumer spending.  He also notes that the market is not pricing in the potential for a multi-year deficit, and that we could run out of cocoa bean inventories, which could lead to a surge in prices. He believes that prices could go up four times over a five-year horizon. The conversation also touches on other commodities like coffee, orange juice, and copper. Andurand believes copper should go up a lot due to electrification and the energy transition. While the Chinese property market is weak, the demand from other parts of the world for electrification will contribute to a copper deficit. Andurand also believes that the US presidential election won't have a significant impact on oil prices. However, a conflict between Ukraine and Russia, particularly if Ukraine were to target Russian oil infrastructure like pipelines and ports, could significantly impact oil prices.
