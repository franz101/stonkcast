*Executive Summary*: A DOJ economist investigates companies for potential violations of antitrust laws, analyzes data, and oversees a team of PhD economists to uncover anti-competitive practices that impact prices, wages, and product quality. They use market share data, head-to-head competition analysis, and company documents to assess market power and potential harm to consumers and workers.


*Summary:*
This episode of the Odd Lots podcast features Joanna Marinescu, principal economist at the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, discussing the impact of antitrust on the economy. They explore the expanded definition of antitrust, the rise of tech giants, and the use of data to identify anti-competitive practices. Marinescu explains how market shares and head-to-head competition data are used to assess potential mergers, such as the blocked Penguin Random House acquisition of Simon & Schuster, based on the potential harm to author advances. The conversation also covers the challenges of measuring innovation and the interplay between antitrust enforcement and industrial policy.
