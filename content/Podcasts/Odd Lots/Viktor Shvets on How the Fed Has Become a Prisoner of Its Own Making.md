*Executive Summary*: The Federal Reserve's commitment to data-dependent policies has created a situation where it is highly reactive to short-term economic data, increasing the risk of policy errors. However, the abundance of capital in the global economy and the willingness of central banks to intervene quickly may mitigate the negative consequences of any policy mistakes.


*Summary:*
This episode of the Odd Lots podcast features Victor Shvetz, a strategist at Macquarie, who discusses the Federal Reserve's data dependency, global macroeconomics, and the potential for a US-China cold war. The hosts, Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal, begin by discussing the recent FOMC meeting and the Fed's characterization as a "monument to stasis." Shvetz argues that the Fed is a "prisoner" of its own data-dependent policies, which create volatility and increase the risk of policy errors. He also criticizes the use of "dots," or the Summary of Economic Projections, as a communication tool, arguing that they magnify volatility and provide little clarity for market participants. Shvetz then explains why he believes a Fed policy error might not matter, citing the abundance of capital in the global economy, instantaneous repricing of assets, and central banks' willingness to intervene quickly to address market disruptions. He argues that the abundance of capital makes it difficult for the Fed to tighten monetary policy effectively and that the risk removed from the financial system through central bank interventions simply migrates elsewhere, into areas such as politics, social issues, and geopolitics. Alloway asks Shvetz about his view of the US economy, noting that he has drawn parallels between the post-pandemic period and the aftermath of the 1918 Spanish Flu. Shvetz explains that he does not believe there will be a recession in the US or globally and that he expects a period of "circular stagnation" with growth rates around 2-2.5%. He also discusses the potential for international consequences of the Fed's "higher for longer" stance on interest rates, noting that the rising dollar is putting pressure on emerging markets and developed economies alike. The conversation then shifts to geopolitics, with Shvetz arguing that China's economic model of exporting deflation is unsustainable and that the country is facing a "catch-22" as other countries erect barriers to Chinese goods. He suggests that China may need to pivot its policies dramatically, sending checks to people instead of investing in new factories, or risk a significant economic slowdown. Shvetz also discusses the potential for a US-China cold war, arguing that the US is trying to "gradually grind China out of the Western system" without disrupting the global economy. He concludes by discussing the potential for a generational shift in political and economic priorities, as younger generations demand more community-based and government-supported policies.
