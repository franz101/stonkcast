*Executive Summary*: The episode reviews 10 stocks presented last year with a goal to make money in a 5+ year time horizon. The top 5 performing stocks were then reviewed and 5 more stocks that would fit the same strategy were added.


*Summary:*
This is a bonus episode of the Stock Advisor roundtable. The hosts are Brian Stoffel and Tom Gardner. The topic is the Stock Advisor's list of 10 stocks to make money. The list was presented about a year ago in February 2023. Tom Gardner clarifies the difference between making money and beating the market. He explains that most people are more interested in making money over the next five years than beating the market. He goes on to say that the time horizon is important and that investors should not evaluate their performance over less than a year. The hosts then go over the 10 stocks that were presented last year. Brian Stoffel summarizes that the stocks on the make money list tend to be less volatile and take on less risk. Tom Gardner adds that they are also generally large cap companies. The hosts then review the performance of the 10 stocks from last year. They reveal that 8 out of 10 stocks made money and 7 out of 10 beat the market. The only two stocks to lose money were Tesla and Paycom. The hosts then discuss the five stocks that Tom Gardner would double down on. He chose Arista Networks, ServiceNow, Airbnb, Costco, and Berkshire Hathaway. The hosts then move on to discuss five more stocks that they think will make money over the next three to five years. Tom Gardner chose Truist, The Trade Desk, PayPal, HubSpot, and Meta. The hosts conclude the episode by emphasizing the importance of a long-term time horizon when investing.
