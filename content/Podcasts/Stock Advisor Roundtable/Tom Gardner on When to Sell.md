*Executive Summary*: Tom Gardner advocates for a long-term approach to investing, suggesting investors rarely need to sell stock, especially if they have identified great companies.


*Summary:*
Tom Gardner, co-founder and CEO of The Motley Fool, discusses his evolving approach to selling stocks over his 30-year investing journey. He highlights that urgency to sell is more common in the early stages due to a lack of experience with market cycles. Over time, he's adopted a longer-term view, emphasizing that the best companies are often worth holding indefinitely. He recounts an instance where Andy Cross, The Motley Fool's chief investment officer, dissuaded him from selling Netflix during a significant stock decline, underscoring the potential for enormous returns with long-term winners. Gardner emphasizes the importance of enduring market volatility and avoiding selling great companies prematurely. He also discusses the value of incremental buying and selling, advocating for a diversified portfolio where individual sales or purchases don't drastically impact overall returns. He acknowledges mistakes like selling Trex due to short-term concerns and emphasizes learning from errors. He uses the analogy of a casino's game of War to illustrate the futility of short-term market timing and advocates for a long-term compounding approach, likening it to planting seeds that grow into significant wealth over time. Gardner argues that holding investments for at least five years, diversifying, and continually learning about your companies increases the probability of success. He concludes by highlighting the Buffett principle of rarely selling, recognizing that while losers may drag down a portfolio, winners will run if given the opportunity.
