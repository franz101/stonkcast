*Summary:*
This Stock Advisor Roundtables bonus episode features Motley Fool co-founder and CEO, Tom Gardner, discussing AI opportunities and concerns in the market.  Despite a new high in the S&P 500, Gardner expresses concern over national debt and the political inability to make tough decisions.  Instead, he focuses on exciting developments in Artificial Intelligence, highlighting its transformative potential and the importance of staying current with AI tools.  Gardner provides insights into his top five AI-related stock picks: Tesla, ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, Arista Networks, and Shopify, explaining why he believes each company is well-positioned to benefit from AI advancements.  He also recommends a small-cap company called NVR, a home builder with a unique land-lite business model, as a stock that should be on the scorecard and predicts Berkshire Hathaway might acquire Kinsale Capital.  Gardner advocates for continuous learning in light of AI's potential to disrupt jobs and emphasizes the importance of dollar-cost averaging for investors.  He concludes by mentioning Dream Finders Homes, a small-cap company following NVR's playbook, as a company worth keeping an eye on.
