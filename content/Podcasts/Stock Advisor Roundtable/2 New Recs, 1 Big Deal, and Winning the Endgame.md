*Executive Summary*: The episode features two new stock recommendations: NICE, a software company focused on customer engagement and compliance applications, and Visa (V), a transaction processing network. Additionally, the team provides an update on an existing recommendation, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac√≠fico (PAC), which has been moved out of the penalty box.  There is no single ‚Äúbig deal‚Äù discussed, but rather a series of market observations and company analyses.


*Summary:*
In this episode of the Stock Advisor Roundtable podcast, the hosts discuss a range of topics relevant to the stock market. Andy Cross shares a rumor about Alphabet potentially acquiring HubSpot for over \$40 billion, Emily Flippen challenges the theory that higher interest rates always lead to lower valuations, and Asit Sharma highlights JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's view on being an ‚Äúendgame winner,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of long-term thinking and adaptability. The team also provides updates on two new stock recommendations, NICE and Visa (V). NICE is a software company focused on customer engagement and compliance applications, benefiting from the transition to cloud-based solutions and the growing adoption of AI. Visa is a transaction processing network with a dominant market position and strong profitability, driven by international and cross-border transactions. The hosts then discuss ‚ÄúWhat We Think Now‚Äù about existing stock recommendations: Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac√≠fico (PAC), Disney, and Apple. PAC is removed from the penalty box due to its resilience against increased tariffs in Mexico. Disney successfully defends against activist investor Trian Partners, led by Nelson Peltz, demonstrating shareholder faith in management. Apple faces various challenges, including declining iPhone sales, setbacks in its electric vehicle project, and a Department of Justice lawsuit, but remains a highly profitable company with significant cash flow. The episode concludes with the hosts sharing their watchlist items for the coming month, including automobile sales (Emily), companies showing intent but not yet achieving their full potential (Asit), and the travel industry's performance (Andy).
